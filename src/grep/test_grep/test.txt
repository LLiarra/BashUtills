Della counted the money. It was one dollar and eighty-seven cents. 
That was all that she could save on vegetables and meat during 5 months.  Della counted it once more. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. 
And the next day would be Christmas. There was nothing to do but sit down and cry. So Della cried. When she finished crying, 
she dried her face and came up by the window. She saw a grey cat walking along a grey fence in a grey back yard. She sighed unhappily 
as the money was not enough to buy her husband Jim a gift. Many hours she had spent planning to buy something nice for him. 
Something fine and rare — something that could be worth belonging to Jim. There was a tall glass mirror between the windows of the room. 
Suddenly Della turned from the window and stood before the glass mirror and looked at herself. 
Then she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length. Now, Jim and Della had two things which they valued. 
One was Jim’s gold watch that had been his father’s and his grandfather’s. 



The other was Della’s hair. So now Della’s beautiful hair fell about her, shining like a brown waterfall. 
It reached below her knees and almost covered her. And then quickly she put it up again. She stood still while a few tears fell on the floor. 
She put on her coat and her old brown hat. Then she run out of the door and down the street. She stopped at the sign: «Madame Sofronie. 
Hair Goods of All Kinds.» Della ran up the steps to the shop. «Will you buy my hair?» asked Della. «I buy hair,» said Madame.
 «Take your hat off and let us have a look at it.» Down came the beautiful brown waterfall of hair. «Twenty dollars,» said Madame. 
 During the next two hours Della looked in all the shops to choose a gift for Jim. She found it at last. It was a chain made of silver. 
 It was perfect for Jim’s gold watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be for him. 
 She gave the shopkeeper twenty-one dollars and hurried home with the eighty-seven cents that was left. 
 When Della arrived home she began to repair what was left of her hair. It was a very big job. 

 It took her forty minutes to make herself look like a schoolboy with her head covered with tiny round curls of hair. 
 She looked in the glass mirror carefully. 
 «If Jim does not kill me before he takes a second look at me,» she said to herself, «he’ll say I look like a song girl. 
 But what could I do — oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?» 
 At seven o’clock that night the coffee was made and the pan on the stove was hot and ready to cook the meat.
